## R interface to Keras

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/keras.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/keras) 

[Keras](https://keras.io/) is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.* Keras has the following key features:

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

- Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural Turing machine.

See the package website at <https://rstudio.github.io/keras> for complete documentation.
